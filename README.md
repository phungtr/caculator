# Unit Testing with JUnit 3 - Calculator Project

## Overview

This project is a simple Java-based Calculator application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. It includes unit tests using JUnit, making it an excellent tool for practicing software testing techniques.

## Features
Perform basic arithmetic operations:

-Addition
-Subtraction
-Multiplication
-Division

Includes JUnit-based unit tests to validate functional

## Requirements

- Java 8 or above
- JUnit 3.8.1
- Maven (for project management)

## How the Project is Tested

Unit tests are written to validate the operations for different scenarios:

  -Normal cases (e.g., 5 + 3 = 8)

  -Edge cases (e.g., division by zero, negative numbers, large values).

Comprehensive assertions ensure the correctness of all arithmetic methods.
